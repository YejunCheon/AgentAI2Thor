To generate the problem file for the given domain and task of putting an apple in the fridge, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify Objects and Initial State

Objects Involved:
- Robots: robot1
- Object: apple
- Object: fridge
- Initial location of apple, fridge

Initial States:
- at-location apple counterTop
- at-location fridge floor
- inaction robot1

Step 2: Define Goals

Goals:
- at-location apple fridge

PDDL Problem File:

```pddl
(define (problem put_apple_in_fridge_problem)
  (:domain robot1)
  (:objects
    robot1 - robot
    apple - object
    fridge - object
    counterTop - object
    floor - object
  )
  (:init
    (at robot1 counterTop)
    (at-location apple counterTop)
    (at-location fridge floor)
    (inaction robot1)
  )
  (:goal
    (and
      (at-location apple fridge)
    )
  )
)
```

Problem file generation is done.
