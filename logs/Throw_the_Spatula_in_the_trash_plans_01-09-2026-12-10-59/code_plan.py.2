To generate the problem file for the given domain and task of throwing the spatula in the trash, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify Objects and Initial State

Objects Involved:
- Robots: robot2
- Object: spatula
- Object: garbageCan

Initial States:
- at-location spatula counterTop
- at-location garbageCan floor
- inaction robot2

Step 2: Define Goals

Goals:
- in-trashcan-location-of-spatula

PDDL Problem File:

```pddl
(define (problem throw_spatula_problem)
  (:domain robot2)
  (:objects
    robot2 - robot
    spatula - object
    garbageCan - object
    counterTop - object
    floor - object
  )
  (:init
    (at robot2 counterTop)
    (at-location spatula counterTop)
    (at-location garbageCan floor)
    (inaction robot2)
  )
  (:goal
    (and
      (in-trashcan-location-of-spatula)
    )
  )
)
```

Problem file generation is done.
