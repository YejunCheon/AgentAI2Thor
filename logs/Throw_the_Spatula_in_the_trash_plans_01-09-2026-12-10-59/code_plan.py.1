To generate the problem file for the given domain and task of moving to the trash can, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify Objects and Initial State

Objects Involved:
- Robots: robot2
- Object: garbageCan
- Initial location of garbageCan

Initial States:
- at-location garbageCan counterTop
- inaction robot2

Step 2: Define Goals

Goals:
- at robot2 garbageCan

PDDL Problem File:

```pddl
(define (problem move_to_trash_can_problem)
  (:domain robot2)
  (:objects
    robot2 - robot
    garbageCan - object
    counterTop - object
  )
  (:init
    (at robot2 counterTop)
    (at-location garbageCan counterTop)
    (inaction robot2)
  )
  (:goal
    (and
      (at robot2 garbageCan)
    )
  )
)
```

Problem file generation is done.
