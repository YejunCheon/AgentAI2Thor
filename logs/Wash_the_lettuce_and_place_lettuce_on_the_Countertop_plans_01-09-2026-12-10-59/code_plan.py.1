To generate the problem file for the given domain and task of picking up the lettuce, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Identify Objects and Initial State

Objects Involved:
- Robots: robot1
- Object: lettuce
- Initial location of lettuce

Initial States:
- at-location lettuce counterTop
- inaction robot1

Step 2: Define Goals

Goals:
- holding robot1 lettuce

PDDL Problem File:

```pddl
(define (problem pick_up_lettuce_problem)
  (:domain robot1)
  (:objects
    robot1 - robot
    lettuce - object
    counterTop - object
  )
  (:init
    (at robot1 counterTop)
    (at-location lettuce counterTop)
    (inaction robot1)
  )
  (:goal
    (and
      (holding robot1 lettuce)
    )
  )
)
```

Problem file generation is done.
