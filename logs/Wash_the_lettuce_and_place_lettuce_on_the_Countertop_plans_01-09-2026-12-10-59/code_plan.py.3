To generate the problem file for the given domain and task of washing lettuce, we need to follow these steps:

Let's start by defining the objects and their initial states based on the provided list and task description.

### Step 1: Identify Objects and Initial State

**Objects Involved:**

- Robots: robot1
- Object: lettuce
- Location: sink

**Initial States:**

- at-location lettuce counterTop
- at robot1 counterTop
- inaction robot1

### Step 2: Define Goals

**Goals:**

- cleaned robot1 lettuce

Now, let's generate the PDDL problem file:

```pddl
(define (problem wash_lettuce_problem)
  (:domain robot1)
  (:objects
    robot1 - robot
    lettuce - object
    sink - object
    counterTop - object
  )
  (:init
    (at robot1 counterTop)
    (at-location lettuce counterTop)
    (inaction robot1)
  )
  (:goal
    (and
      (cleaned robot1 lettuce)
    )
  )
)
```

Problem file generation is done.
