To generate the problem file for the given domain and task of going to the countertop, we need to follow these steps:

Let's start by defining the objects and their initial states based on the provided list and task description.

### Step 1: Identify Objects and Initial State

**Objects Involved:**

- Robots: robot1
- Object: countertop
- Object: lettuce

**Initial States:**

- at-location lettuce countertop
- holding robot1 lettuce
- inaction robot1

### Step 2: Define Goals

**Goals:**

- at robot1 countertop

Now, let's generate the PDDL problem file:

```pddl
(define (problem goto_countertop_problem)
  (:domain robot1)
  (:objects
    robot1 - robot
    lettuce - object
    countertop - object
  )
  (:init
    (holding robot1 lettuce)
    (at-location lettuce countertop)
    (inaction robot1)
  )
  (:goal
    (and
      (at robot1 countertop)
    )
  )
)
```

Problem file generation is done.
