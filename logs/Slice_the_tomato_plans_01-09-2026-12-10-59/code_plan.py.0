To generate the problem file for the given domain and task of slicing a tomato, we need to follow these steps:

Let's start by defining the objects and their initial states based on the provided list and task description.

### Step 1: Identify Objects and Initial State

**Objects Involved:**

- Robots: robot1, robot2, robot3
- Object: tomato
- Object: knife
- Initial location of tomato, knife

**Initial States:**

- `at-location tomato counterTop`
- `at-location knife counterTop`
- `inaction robot1`
- `inaction robot2`
- `inaction robot3`

### Step 2: Define Goals

**Goals:**

- `sliced tomato`

Now, let's generate the PDDL problem file:

```pddl
(define (problem slice_tomato_problem)
  (:domain robot1)
  (:objects
    robot1 - robot
    robot2 - robot
    robot3 - robot
    tomato - object
    knife - object
    counterTop - object
  )
  (:init
    (at-location tomato counterTop)
    (at-location knife counterTop)
    (inaction robot1)
    (inaction robot2)
    (inaction robot3)
  )
  (:goal
    (and
      (sliced tomato)
    )
  )
)
```

Problem file generation is done.
